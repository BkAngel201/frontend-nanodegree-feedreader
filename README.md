# Feed Read Project (Test Suite)


This project is the finished test Suite of a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The project was made for another developer but the test suit was incompleted, so my work was finished it.



## How to Use 


- Download the files fron the [repository](https://github.com/BkAngel201/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git), use the **index.html** file to open the project.

- The page will load the RSS feed at the top and the jasmine test result at the bottom.

- Use the hamburger button at the top left corner to change the Feed Topic.
